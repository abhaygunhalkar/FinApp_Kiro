## High-Level Flow

### Adding a Holding

```
User enters ticker + quantity + buy price + broker in the UI

```

- `BROKERS` — comma-separated list of broker options shown in the dropdown
- `REFRESH_INTERVAL_MINUTES` — how often the background scheduler fetches prices (1-1440)

  "success": true,
  "data": { ... },
  "error": null
}
```

On error:
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "data": null,
  "error": "Human-readable error message"
